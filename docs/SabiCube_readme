SabiCube 1.1 alpha

A single-player total conversion of Cube2-Sauerbraten with focus on adding rpg/adventure elements.
This package includes first chapter of the game ZetaProject, a test-map to display the new features, and houndreds of open-source models and textures game-ready.
The goal is to make gamebuilding as fun as playing a game, with intuitive menus and guides to help anyone make their own open-source rpg/adventure game, without prior knowledge of programming or 3D-modeling.
This is a work in progress so editor-workflow might change in future releases as we add features to the engine, but maps from the original sauerbraten (or compatible engines) will be able to load with minor adjustment.
SabiCube is tested on 64-bit (Kubuntu) and 32-bit (KXStudio), and we have provided a binary for both, so it should work, if you are lucky, If not... please follow the installguide found here : https://github.com/sandsound/sabicube/wiki#installing
