SabiCube 1.1
============

A single-player total conversion of Cube2-Sauerbraten with focus on adding rpg/adventure elements.
The 1.1 release will focus on classic rpg-style, including the game Age Of Reason and as always, a test-map for the new features.
The goal is to make the gamebuilding process as fun as playing a game, with intuitive menus and guides
to help anyone make their own open-source rpg/adventure game, without prior knowledge of programming or 3D-modeling.
Some additions to SabiCube 1.1 will temporarely break support for the game ZetaProject, but SabiCube 1.0 are still available for download at http://www.moddb.com/mods/sabicube.
The two game-modes will be merged later in a 2.0 release.

SabiCube is tested on 64-bit (Kubuntu) and 32-bit (KXStudio), and installing should be fairly simple, just follow this guide: https://github.com/sandsound/sabicube/wiki#installing
