SabiCube 1.3
============

A single-player total conversion of Cube2-Sauerbraten with focus on adding rpg/adventure elements.
The goal is to make the gamebuilding process as fun as playing a game, with intuitive menus and guides
to help anyone make their own open-source rpg/adventure game, without prior knowledge of programming or 3D-modeling.

The 1.3 release will focus on automization of scripting and expanding alchemy/cooking, it includes a very early beta of the game Age Of Reason and as always, a test-map for the new features. Some additions to SabiCube 1.3 might temporarily break support for the game ZetaProject, but it should still be playable, and if you find a bug, please let me know.

SabiCube is tested on 64-bit (Kubuntu 14.04) and 32-bit (Linux Mint 15 Xfce), and installing should be fairly simple, just follow this guide: https://github.com/sandsound/sabicube/wiki#installing (there are currently only binarys for Linux).
